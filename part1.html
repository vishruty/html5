Hagrid takes Harry to Diagon Alley to purchase school supplies, then takes him to King's Cross station to board a train to the school.

			While on the train, Harry meets Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. He also encounters Draco Malfoy, a spoiled child from a wealthy wizarding family, who eventually becomes Harry's biggest rival.

			Harry suspects that potions teacher Severus Snape is trying to obtain the stone in order to return Voldemort to physical form.

			After getting past the tasks, Harry discovers that it was Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher Professor Quirrell who was trying to claim the stone, and that Snape was protecting Harry all along. Quirrell removes his turban and reveals a weak Voldemort to be living on the back of his head. Through an enchantment placed by Professor Dumbledore, Harry finds himself in possession of the stone. Voldemort attempts to convince Harry to give him the stone by promising to bring his parents back from the dead. When Harry refuses, Quirrell attacks, but Harry's touch burns Quirrell's skin and reduces him to dust, killing him. When Harry gets back up, Voldemort's spirit rises from Quirrell's ashes and passes through Harry, knocking him unconscious.

			Harry wakes up in the school's hospital wing with Dumbledore at his side. Dumbledore explains that the stone has been destroyed and that Ron and Hermione are both fine. Dumbledore also reveals how Harry was able to defeat Quirrel;, because when Harry's mother died to save him, her death gave Harry a love-based protection against Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded with house points for their heroic performances, tying them for first place with Slytherin. However, Neville Longbottom is awarded 10 points for attempting to stop his friends, giving Gryffindor enough points to win the House Cup.</div>
